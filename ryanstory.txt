Once upon a time there was a crocodile named Jeff who was out wondering the African desert
when he ran into an armadillo.  Both Jeff and the armadillo were in desperate need of finding water
because the desert was going through one of its longest dry spells. Jeff decided that instead of eating
the armadillo they needed to join forces if they wanted to find water.
