Once upon a time there was a crocodile named Jeff who was out wondering the African desert
when he ran into an armadillo.  Both Jeff and the armadillo were in desperate need of finding water
because the desert was going through one of its longest dry spells. Jeff decided that instead of eating
the armadillo they needed to join forces if they wanted to find water

"Lets go east" said Jeff.  "I heard from the buffalo that there is water in that direction."  So Jeff
and the armadillo Craig started walking east.  For two days Jeff and Craig walked.  With temperatures above
90 degrees 12 hours when the sun was up and 45 degrees when the sun went down they continued without a drop
of water in sight.  Both were losing hope quickely, and when they got over a sand dune, they noticed a lone
cub laying under a tree.
